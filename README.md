# Wordle_Game
Simple wordle game played in the terminal. Written in C.
Execute '.exit' to end the game.

The best part is you can replace the word list with your own words, and add in words you want to add as valid guesses.
Just edit the guess_list.txt file or word_list.txt file !
  1. Each word must be in a separate line (i.e '\n' delimited)
  2. Words should be all caps (lower case works, but the program is case sensetive, so if the word is "LITTLE", "little" is not a correct answer.

word_list.txt contains all the words that can be chosen as the answer by the program.
guess_list.txt contains all the words that are allowed as valid guesses.

The guesses are case sensitive, case of a word in the guess_list must match the case of the word inputted.
